SMARTEN: A multiscale simulation software for smartgrid management

SMARTEN (Smart Management AlgoRiThm of Electricity Network) is a multi-scale calculation tool for the management of mixed electrical energy flows developed by the scientists from the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment (PIMENT), University of La Reunion, 117 rue du Général Ailleret, 97430 Le Tampon, France and the Higher Institute of Technology of Antananarivo (I.S.T), Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Iadiambola Ampasampito, Po Box 8122, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar.

The software has been gradually built up for more than six years through research projects.  The first step was to think of management scenarios of the systems. The second stage was to build the specific algorithms that define the smart grids. The algorithms of SMARTEN were compared with the best software (i.e., HOMER) available in the field of smart grids simulation. Finally, a graphical user interface was created in Matlab to enable the computation of larger matrixes.

This repository contains all codes necessary to run SMARTEN and it allows the community to re-use and improve the software.

In the "Data" branch, there are 3 files, that are necessary to run a simulation in SMARTEN v1.0.
- "andravoahangy_tsena.shp" is an example of map that is necessary to run the 2D visualization of SMARTEN.
- "smarten_inputs_20buildings.xlsx" is an example of the inputs file. In this case, 20 buildings are used in the simulation.
- "smarten_parameters_20buildings.xlsx" is an example of the parameters file. In this case also, it corresponds to the parameters of 20 buildings.
